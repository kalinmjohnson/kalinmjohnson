### Hey Fellow People!

As you probably picked up from my profile, my name is Kalin Johnson, and I am now a junior at Bethel University studying Computer Science and Physics.  Throughout the last several years, I have figured out that I love learning new things, finding organization in chaos, and building cool projects.  You can take a look at some of the things I have done here including coursework, summer research, and personal projects.  Hope you find something interesting! :)

In case you were curious about my background, here's a little spiel about some of the things I have done.

During Summer 2022 I worked as a research assistant in Bethel University's particle physics group. I learned technical skills such as cloud computing, C++, Python, and debugging skills while analyzing particle collision data from the Compact Muon Solenoid Experiment to replicate the discovery of the Higgs Boson for an undergraduate lab.

The following summer in 2023, I worked as a research assistant again under that same professor and in a similar group.  This time I revamped a multi-step condor analysis for the BtoTW particle physics analysis. This setup uses Python, Bash, and C++ to run a parallel analysis on a huge number of events and trim it down to highlight interesting trends in the data.  On a side note, I got to travel to CERN with my professor and another student, which was a fantastic experience!  Switzerland is a beautiful country!


While in school, I am also working as a teaching assistant for course such as Introductory C++ and Algorithms and Advanced Data Structures.
In the evenings, I tutor in the on-campus help center for math and computer science courses.  I love helping students understand concepts and overcome challenges in their code!

In my free time, I am an officer in Bethel's branch of the Society of Physics Students, and I am a fellow in the business mentorship program on campus, where I help organize and run events.

I'm impressed if you have read this far and I would love to talk, so don't hesitate to reach out!

Fun Fact: I have a special place in my heart for the mountains and love hiking, backpacking, and mountain biking! :)
